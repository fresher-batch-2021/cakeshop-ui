    <h2>HYGIENE</h2>
Since we have a wide variety of confectionery products, hygiene takes the highest priority for our entire workforce. Our food handlers have been trained to follow sound practices to ensure that anything that we serve is safe for consumption. To ensure that, we not only stipulate that they wear head caps and gloves, but we also conduct periodic audits on how they maintain their personal hygiene from trimming nails to self grooming. So when your loaf of bread gets sliced, it will be done by hygienic hands.
